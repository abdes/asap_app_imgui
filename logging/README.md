# Logging submodule for the asap project

See the asap project on [github](https://github.com/abdes/asap) for a functional
minimal starter project that uses this submodule.

project for the recommended container to fully leverage this submodule and add other 
libraries/executables/etc... to the top level project.

Implementation of this module uses the following:
  - unit testing using Catch2
  - documentation using restructured text with [sphinx](http://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/)
  - API documentation using [doxygen](http://www.doxygen.org), translated to reST using
    [breathe](https://breathe.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)
